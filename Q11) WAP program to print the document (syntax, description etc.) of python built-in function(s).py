functions, classes, and methods. It's specified in source code that is used, like a comment, to document a specific 
segment of code.

The abs() function is used to return the absolute value of a number.

The abs() takes only one argument, a number whose absolute value is to be returned. The argument can be an integer, a 
floating point number or a complex number.

   -- If the argument is an integer or floating point number, abs() returns the absolute value in integer or float.
   -- In case of complex number, abs() returns only the magnitude part and that can also be a floating point number.
